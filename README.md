2. Two Pointers
3. Sliding Window
4. Prefix Sum
5. Hash Map / Set
6. Stack
7. Queue
8. Linked List
9. Binary Tree - DFS

11. Binary Search Tree
12. Graphs - DFS
13. Graphs - BFS
14. Heap / Priority Queue
15. Binary Search
16. Backtracking
17. DP - 1D

19. Bit Manipulation
20. Trie
21. Intervals
22. Monotonic Stack

### Each sub-folder within a "Problem Type Folder" includes the Problem, Solution, and an Editorial explaining how to run through each problem.

Study Guide for myself, `Link Lee`, featuring the LeetCode 75 problem set written in Python3. You're welcome to use it as much as needed to study and understand certain syntax, breakdowns of problems (ability to read the problem correctly), and Solutions written in readable concise code. I personally understand and retain code better when it is written out by hand (pen & paper) or through a fully hand typed file. Helps to actually memorize what is going on and hold on to that information since sometimes I'm a big dumb dumb and can't even remember my own birthday half the time.

Plus half those YouTube videos on "HoW tO LaNd A fAanG jOb Ez pZ iN 15 MinUteS" don't actually do sh*t for you.
